# Domains

You can easily add your own domains to Coolify or your resources.

All domain fields are capable to generate your proxy configurations based on the following rules:

1. You need to use FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) format: `https://coolify.io`
2. You can give multiple domains, separated by comma: `https://coolify.io,https://www.coolify.io`
3. You can also add a port to the domain, so the proxy will know which port you would like to map to the domain: `https://coolify.io:8080,http://api.coolify.io:3000`


## Wildcard Domain

You can set a wildcard domain (`example: http://example.com`) to your server, so you can easily assign generated domains to all the resources connected to this server. [More details](/servers.md#wildcard-domain)
