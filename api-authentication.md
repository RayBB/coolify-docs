# Authentication

API request requires a `Bearer` token in `Authorization` header, which could be generated from the UI.

## Generate a Token

Go to `Security` menu -> API tokens.

Define a name for your token and click `Create New Token`.

You will see the token once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.

## Scope

Tokens are scoped for your currently active Team. If you switch to another team, you will see the tokens for that team.

:::warning
As API is still under heavy development, member roles are not yet implemented. So, all tokens have the same permissions.
:::

## Revoking a Token

Go to `Security` menu -> API tokens and simple click `Revoke` button for the token you want to revoke.
