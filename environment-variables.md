# Environment Variables

You can define environment variables for your resources, and they will be available in your application.

> Preview Deployments could have different environment variables, so you can test your application as a staging environment for example.

## Build Time Variables

If you would like to set environment variables for the build process, you can do by setting `Build Variable` on the UI.


## Developer / Normal View

You can see your environment variables in a developer view (like `.env`) and in a normal view. 

:::tip
Developer view are useful to quickly overwrite or copy all your variables.
:::

## Predefined Variables

Coolify predefines some variables for you, so you can use them in your application. All you need to do is to add an environment variable like this

```bash
# For example, you can use this variable in your application
MY_VARIABLE=$SOURCE_COMMIT
# You will have the commit hash of the source code in your application as an environment variable in MY_VARIABLE
```

### `SOURCE_COMMIT`
Commit hash of the source code.
