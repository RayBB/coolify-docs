# GitHub Actions

You can use Github Actions to build your image and deploy it to Coolify.

Here is an [example repository](https://github.com/andrasbacsai/github-actions-with-coolif) and a [workflow file](https://github.com/andrasbacsai/github-actions-with-coolify/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml) that you can check how it works.

## Process Overview

1. You need to create a [Github Action workflow](https://github.com/andrasbacsai/github-actions-with-coolify/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml) file in your repository.
2. You need to build your image and push it to a Docker registry. In the example, I use ghcr.io, but you can use any other registry.
   - Example: `ghcr.io/andrasbacsai/github-actions-with-coolify:latest`
3. You need to create a [Coolify API Token](./api-authentication.md#generate-a-token) and add it to your Github repository secrets.
   - Example:  `COOLIFY_TOKEN`
4. In Coolify, you need to setup your deployment type. It could be a simple Dockerfile, Docker Compose or Docker Image based deployment.
5. Get the proper webhook endpoint from Coolify (Your resource / `Webhook` menu) and add it to your Github repository secrets.
   - Example: `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK`
6. Need to send a GET request to that webhook endpoint (authenticated with the token) to trigger the deployment
   - Example: <span v-pre>`curl --request GET '${{ secrets.COOLIFY_WEBHOOK }}' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.COOLIFY_TOKEN }}'`</span>
7. That's it! Now you can push to your repository and the deployment will be triggered automatically.
