# Backups

Scheduled database backups could be configured for PostgreSQL and for Coolify itself.

This schedules are based on cron expressions, so you can configure them to run as often as you want.

You can also use simple cron expressions like:

```js
const VALID_CRON_STRINGS = [
    'every_minute' => '* * * * *',
    'hourly' => '0 * * * *',
    'daily' => '0 0 * * *',
    'weekly' => '0 0 * * 0',
    'monthly' => '0 0 1 * *',
    'yearly' => '0 0 1 1 *',
];
```

## PostgreSQL
Coolify creates a full backup of your PostgreSQL databases. You can specify which database to backup, with a comma separated list.

:::tip
Coolify own database is also backed up using this method.
:::

### Backup command
```bash
pg_dump --format=custom --no-acl --no-owner --username <username> <databaseName>
```
### Restore command

The backup has custom format, so you can restore it using the following command (or with any equivalent tool):

```bash
pg_restore --verbose --clean -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres pg-dump-postgres-1697207547.dmp
```
## MySQL

```bash
mysqldump -u root -p <password> <datatabaseName>
```

## MariaDB

```bash
mariadb-dump -u root -p <password> <datatabaseName>
```

## MongoDB

```bash
mongodump --authenticationDatabase=admin --uri=<uri> --gzip --archive=<archive>
```

Or if you exclude some collections:

```bash
mongodump --authenticationDatabase=admin --uri=<uri> --gzip --archive=<archive> --excludeCollection=<collectionName> --excludeCollection=<collectionName>
```

## S3 Backups
You can also define your own S3 compatible storage to store your backups. 

### Supported
Currently supported S3 compatible storages are:
  - AWS
  - DigitalOcean Spaces
  - MinIO
  - Cloudflare's R2
  - Backblaze B2

Other's could work, but not tested yet. If you test it, please let us know.

### S3 Client

Coolify uses MinIO's client, called [`mc`](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html), to copy the backup files to your S3 compatible storage.


### Verification
To be able to use your S3 compatible storage, you need to verify it first. Verification done with `ListObjectsV2` request to your specified bucket.

So you need to create a bucket first, and then you can verify it.
