# Service Templates

Service templates are predefined normal [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/) files + a bit of magic.

## The bit of Magic

To be able to predefine values, like usernames, passwords, fqdns, predefined values for bind (file) mounts etc, the docker-compose files are extended with a few keywords. 

> More magic coming soon ðŸª„

--- 

In the [enviroment](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#environment) option, you can do the following. 

Let's use `APPWRITE` as an example with a generate UUID of `vgsco4o` and with a [wildcard](/servers.md#wildcard-domain) domain of `http://example.com`.

--- 

### FQDN

This will [generate](/servers.md#wildcard-domain) a FQDN for appwrite service.

```yaml
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/
        - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE 
```

If you use the same variable on another service, it will generate the same FQDN for you. 

```yaml
# This does not make sense, just here to show you how it works.
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/
        - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE 
    not-appwrite:
      environment:
        # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/
        - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE
```

You sometimes need the same domain, but with different **paths**.

```yaml
# This make sense, not like the previous.
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/
        - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE
    not-appwrite:
      environment:
        # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/v1/realtime
        - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE=/v1/realtime 
    definitely-not-appwrite:
      environment:
        # As SERVICE_FQDN_API is not the same as SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE
        # Coolify will generate a new FQDN 
        # http://definitely-not-appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/api
        - SERVICE_FQDN_API=/api
```

You can reuse this generated FQDN anywhere.

```yaml
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/
        - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE 
        - _APP_URL=$SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE # _APP_URL will have the FQDN because SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE is just a simple environment variable
```

You sometimes need the same domain, but with different **ports**. This will tell the proxy which port to proxy to which domain.
In the example, we combine paths and ports.

```yaml
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/ will be proxied to port 3000
        - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE_3000
        # http://api-vgsco4o.example.com/api will be proxied to port 2000
        - SERVICE_FQDN_API_2000=/api
```

This could be used as a value as well. No default value allowed.

```yaml
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # http://api-vgsco4o.example.com/api defined here
        - SERVICE_FQDN_API_2000=/api
        # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/ will be proxied to port 3000
        - APPWRITE_URL=$SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE_3000
        # http://api-vgsco4o.example.com/api will be proxied to port 2000
        - APPWRITE_API_URL=$SERVICE_FQDN_API_2000
```

### Username

Example: `$SERVICE_USER_APPWRITE`

Generator: `Str::random(16)`

```yaml
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # qwhraJlpdkyKYSQ1 (generated by Laravel's )
        - APPWRITE_USERNAME=$SERVICE_USER_APPWRITE 
```

--- 

### Password

Example: `$SERVICE_PASSWORD_APPWRITE`

Generator: `Str::password(symbols: false)`
 
```yaml
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # m5XOD0uY4k1hXgISYoJyLdPHG7oAbNYw 
        - APPWRITE_PASSWORD=$SERVICE_PASSWORD_APPWRITE
```

You can also generate 64 bit long password.

Example: `$SERVICE_PASSWORD_64_APPWRITE`

Generator: `Str::password(length: 64, symbols: false)`

```yaml
services:
    appwrite:
      environment:
        # J0QT0Cqr2ArmIT4RgTwK5F5lcXShgnJ53XTiHjqBbPntWVVG8DRHKnrsIjXBZJ8e 
        - APPWRITE_PASSWORD=$SERVICE_PASSWORD_64_APPWRITE
```

## How to test templates

You can easily test your templates with `Docker Compose` deployments inside Coolify. It uses the same process to parse, generate and deploy as the one-click services.

## How to add to the official templates

Official templates stored [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/templates/service-templates.json) at the moment (could be change in the future) with the following format:

```json
{
  "umami": {
      // Documentation link, otherwise it will go to https://coolify.io/docs .
      "documentation": "https://umami.is/docs/getting-started",
      // A slogan to show on the dashboard.
      "slogan": "Umami makes it easy to collect, analyze, and understand your web data â€” while maintaining visitor privacy and data ownership.",
      // The actual compose file, encoded in base64 to save parsing/escaping issues.
      "compose": "c2VydmljZXM6IAogIHVtYW1pOgogICAgaW1hZ2U6IGdoY3IuaW8vdW1hbWktc29mdHdhcmUvdW1hbWk6cG9zdGdyZXNxbC1sYXRlc3QKICAgIGVudmlyb25tZW50OgogICAgICAtIFNFUlZJQ0VfRlFETl9VTUFNSQogICAgICAtIERBVEFCQVNFX1VSTD1wb3N0Z3JlczovLyRTRVJWSUNFX1VTRVJfUE9TVEdSRVM6JFNFUlZJQ0VfUEFTU1dPUkRfUE9TVEdSRVNAcG9zdGdyZXNxbDo1NDMyLyRQT1NUR1JFU19EQgogICAgICAtIERBVEFCQVNFX1RZUEU9cG9zdGdyZXMKICAgICAgLSBBUFBfU0VDUkVUPSRTRVJWSUNFX1BBU1NXT1JEXzY0X1VNQU1JCiAgICBkZXBlbmRzX29uOgogICAgICBwb3N0Z3Jlc3FsOgogICAgICAgIGNvbmRpdGlvbjogc2VydmljZV9oZWFsdGh5CiAgcG9zdGdyZXNxbDoKICAgIGltYWdlOiBwb3N0Z3JlczoxNS1hbHBpbmUKICAgIHZvbHVtZXM6CiAgICAgIC0gcG9zdGdyZXNxbC1kYXRhOi92YXIvbGliL3Bvc3RncmVzcWwvZGF0YQogICAgZW52aXJvbm1lbnQ6CiAgICAgIC0gUE9TVEdSRVNfVVNFUj0kU0VSVklDRV9VU0VSX1BPU1RHUkVTCiAgICAgIC0gUE9TVEdSRVNfUEFTU1dPUkQ9JFNFUlZJQ0VfUEFTU1dPUkRfUE9TVEdSRVMKICAgICAgLSBQT1NUR1JFU19EQj0ke1BPU1RHUkVTX0RCOi11bWFtaX0KICAgIGhlYWx0aGNoZWNrOgogICAgICB0ZXN0OiBbIkNNRC1TSEVMTCIsICJwZ19pc3JlYWR5IC1VICQke1BPU1RHUkVTX1VTRVJ9IC1kICQke1BPU1RHUkVTX0RCfSJdCiAgICAgIGludGVydmFsOiA1cwogICAgICB0aW1lb3V0OiA1cwogICAgICByZXRyaWVzOiAxMA=="
